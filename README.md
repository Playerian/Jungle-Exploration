# Javascripts:
Adding events: For you to add events, go to line 417 or so, and there is a function call event list, then follow the instruction there.

Buttons: there are 3 classes of buttons in html. 
B is class that only contains north, west, east, and south, they need to be hide if you want to introduce new buttons. 
B2 is all the buttons, it is associated with css.
B3 is all the hidden buttons that can be use when you need to introduce new buttons.

Don't change the text of the button in HTML, use jquery to do it instead in script.

There are some hidden buttons in html, like b5, b6, and b7. If you want to add a new button, first, you need to hide all the B class buttons as they are the 4 directions therefore need to be hided. Then you can introduce new buttons by showing different buttons by their id. For a new introduced button to work, first, you need to add a variable to differentiate the event that is happening with other events. Then go to around line 680, there are functions associate with clicking of the hidden buttons. Remember to show all the Bs and hide all the B3s once the event is complete.

Developer's Hut: First, add a button and related varible in function DevHutMenu. Then do anything you want in that button. Remember to diffrentiate it with other buttons with a variable, or else it will go wrong.

# Letter From Dr.Italic
  _Hi, I'm Dr.Italic._ 
  
  _My whole life has been devoted into the mystery that is yet to be solved by science. But, well things happened. I've seen a lot of, curses, in ancient tribes, totems that's being praise by villages, faithful villagers jumping down wells to cleanse themselves...... But nothing seems real. Now I know I was wrong, maybe, just maybe, there is really some kind of mysterious power that is controlling the world around us. So I've made a decision, a life changing decision-- I will visit and explore this jungle that no one has ever step foot on and...returned. I flew to the jungle with my research team on my private jet, and as we were skimming the top of the lush, tranquil jungle roof, a giant beast launched straight up from under the green blankets of trees and brought our plane down into the jungle, I lay, almost lifelessly, dark dots engulfing my vision rapidly, everything blacked out... When I finally woke up, after who knows how long, I found myself hidden, covered in huge, rotting leaves. I got up and quickly found out that all of my research team had gone, includeing the pilot, and my long time friend, Bold. Strangely, there was nobody lying around. I gathered what I can quickily and ran out of the place in a flash... Finally, I stooped in an area engulfed by white fog, why was there snow in the fog, I don't know, and well, I don't really have space in my mind to care now after all I just saw... I built a little snowman to inspire myself, and settled down to think how I am going to survive in this jungle. Until one day, a man come to me.._
  
  _He looks like a good guy, but I don't know where he came from, and he never tells me anything about his... anything. Only that he tells me that when I get the compass, I can know the secret of the jungle. Then, old stuffs happen, adventure, mystery, beast attacking, all sorts of things. Then I finally found the compass, and it leads me to the north. Right there, I saw a ruin, but as its name indicates, its actually a huge castle, untouched by human, teeming with vines. In there, I saw a beast, very different than the one that I have fought, I got defeat in seconds. I thought that man is gonna to help me, but he doesn't. Later, I was trapped in the prison of the ruin. That man appears and talk to me, he claims himself Nero, the King of Roman, and all the beasts are his avatars. I was shocked, but I still accept his view point. Nero said that he was going to kill me soon, and, without mercy, he actually did. I didn't die, as I know that, I become the tiniest dust, but not dead. It was until then, I know the power of the Roman Aura that is active all the time which keep people in the jungle alive. Like you, you must have try to explore the jungle multiple times, don't you? But everytime you are dead, starve to death, beaten by the beast, you always come back at the origin, you never die. That's the Roman Aura, keeping you alive all the time. Well, enough talk, now you know who am I, do what you suppose to do._

_Sincerely,_

_Dr.Italic_

# About the Black Village
  _You know about the Black Village right? There are a lots of mystery about this village, but one thing can be sure. If you get to this
Black Village, you will know what I meant. The buildings are white, but in contrast, all villagers are black, pure black. It's not like
their skin color is black or anything, but their whole body, is black, I attached an illustration on the back of the envelop to let you
know what is that looks like. Well, they are still, considerably, humans. Somehow, they can't leave the Black Village, its like a special force that holds them there. _

  _One quick story, I saw someone in the Black Village that looks like my long time friend, Bold. What looks like means is that his hair style is pretty similar. What interest me is that I found Bold's pendant in his house. Now I really think that he is Bold, but I was not sure. I try to ask him directly, he doesn't answer anything. After that, I give up trying, just knowing that he is fine is enough for me.

# About the Roman Aura
  _The Roman Aura keeps people alive, you know that right? But I after my research, not all people will be kept alive by Roman Aura, only some, but they all got a same characteristic: the will to live. People without the will to live will be treated as a lost soul, not dead, not alive, only merely a human shape. They also will slowly lose theor memory, little by little, as they can not gain more. And yes, they're the black villagers. My friend, Bold, also a member of thr the black villager, has lost his memory. I feel sad, so, never give up your will to live. If uou lose your will to live, you are a merely phantom, lost in the black village.
  
# Julius Caesar's words
  You know me, right? I'm Julius Caesar, emperor of Rome. After a long period of waiting, I get a thought, of not living anymore. At first, it's only a small thought, but as time progress, it gets bigger and bigger. Now, I'm near the edge of being blacken. I have always in regrets of one things, the building of the Roman Aura, it keeps people who should be dead alive. Its very bad, very very bad. Only one thing I can be sure, I'll be blacken in a few day, so, young man, if you want, do you want to be the king of Rome?

# Julius Caesar's more words
  Thank you, I know its hard for you, but being a king is no joke, its more like you bear all the responsibility for protecting the citizens, but remember, the most important thing for a king is its citizen. Good luck, young man. Also, if you have a chance, can you destroy the Roman Aura for me? I don't want to live more, no one wants to live more.

# About Tree of Life(Base64)
Tree of Life, is the essentials of all life, in the form of a tree. It is located in the deeps of the jungle to the west. In a desolate area in that part of the jungle, there lies the Tree of Life. Every part of the Tree of Life is connected to all the other parts of the tree, even the slightest tear in the woods will result in irreversible damage to the tree. The Tree of Life usually don't show its internal power, but it can heal even the deepest wounds... 

# Julius Caesar and Tree of Life
I have regret that I tore down that holy...stick. I still remember the time... I was devoured by the will of staying alive, so I came to this part of the jungle where no one has ever came before. I tore down the branch, the most precious, the most important, the first and the only branch that the Tree of Life has... As soon as the branch leaves the tree, the tree starts to shrink, it kept shrinking, shrinking, until it was as tiny as a turf of grass. I used that holy branch and built a glorious altar, and that, is what keeps everyone alive, the Roman Aura.

we voyage far

for tresures thats lost 

in the shadows of history

remain unknown to man


If you go east

You encounter the beast

The beast escape to east

the chase has cease
